# Seir: From Narrative to Network: A Spatio-Temporal GIS Analysis of the Prophetic Sira

This repository contains the data, GIS analysis files, and code for the research project, "From Narrative to Network." We transform the classic narrative of the Prophet's life (Sira) from a linear text into a dynamic, multi-dimensional spatio-temporal network.

By leveraging Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Spatial Network Analysis, this project moves beyond *what* happened to explore *how and why it happened spatially*, revealing the geographical logic and logistical complexity of the early Islamic state.
